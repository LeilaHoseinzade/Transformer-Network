# [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) course on Coursera
Some of the programming projects from the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) course are available here. This series of courses is offered by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) and Andrew Ng is the instructor.  

# Credit
This repo is my work for [Deep learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) projects and the code base was taken from Corsera's Deepl Learning Specialization.

# Recomendations
The specialization contains five courses, from beginner level to advanced level. It is a very well-structured course and the projects give you hands-on experience on topics. It is highly recommended.
